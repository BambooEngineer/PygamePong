# PygamePong
Pong game with Pygame 


The JPGs in the intro function are all the same but just flipped so its like a loading screen, Needed help with how to detect collision with the ball and 'paddles' and found some mathmatical code from another pygame game. It works better than my first pygame attempt, only thing that couldn't be done was controller support.
